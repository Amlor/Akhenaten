## Aim of the project

The aim of Akhenaten is to re-create the exact same logic that the original Pharaoh uses, with full savegame
compatibility, but with some small user interface enhancements.

Later on there may be an 'enhanced' edition with new features, but for now any pull requests which change the game logic
or alter the UI in a major way will be declined.
