57-24:  No one is asking for educational facilities yet. As the city grows in stature, though, people will expect Scribal Schools, followed later by demands for Libraries.

58-10:  Parts of the city grumble that they have no access to recreation. Building more entertainment venues would help these poorer areas develop.
58-11:  Some people whine about inadequate entertainment in their neighborhoods. You may need to offer more variety, or perhaps build more performer schools to provide artists for venues that lack them.
58-12:  Some Booths or Bandstands have empty stages.  More jugglers or musicians would satisfy neighborhoods that are complaining of poor entertainment.
58-13:  Your Pavilions need more dancers.  A new Conservatory could boost local entertainment levels in parts of the city.

59-9:  Residents are beginning to feel spiritual needs.  The absence of nearby places of worship holds back city development.
59-10:  More and more people fear that, without at least one place of worship in their neighborhoods, the gods will feel spurned.
59-11:  More sophisticated residents want access to another religion close to home. Lack of religious diversity limits city development in certain areas.
59-12:  Discerning citizens say that their neighborhoods would attract a better class of scribe if they had easy access to a third religion.
59-13:  So far, people are too preoccupied with physical needs to think about religion. As your city grows, though, they will want easy access to a variety of Temples.
59-14:  Everyone's particular religious beliefs are served, and the priests report that the gods are satisfied with the city's spirituality.
59-15:  Osiris' displeasure is dangerous. He can destroy your crops and empty your Granaries, or even withhold the Inundation.
59-16:  When mighty Ra, father to Pharaoh, grows displeased, he will make your city's neighbors share his feeling. Ra's anger endangers harmony with the Kingdom.  
59-17:  Ptah, whose beneficence your manufacturers require, grows unhappy. Regain his favor, or brace your workers for the loss of whole industries and products.
59-18:  The bravest soldiers tremble before the wrath of Seth. Repair the god's opinion of your city quickly, or watch your battalion be swept away!
59-19:  When kind Bast becomes upset, people are not safe in their own homes. Placate the goddess swiftly, or destruction and pestilence will follow!

59-32:  Osiris is the god of the Nile flood, and all life which springs from the underworld. With his benevolence, your city may receive the blessing of a bountiful annual Inundation, bringing life-giving fertile soil to your fields.  He can also improve the yield at harvest time in other ways. An Altar of Sebek - god of fertility - means that priests of Osiris can help your citizens stretch their food and other supplies a little farther, while an Oracle of Min - god of regeneration - infuses the wildlife in and around your city with greater vitality. His Oracle makes animal herds and fish colonies more resilient, and even accelerates the regrowth of some plants. 
59-33:  As god of the Kingdom, Ra facilitates trade and travel throughout the known world, and can even help to bolster your reputation throughout Egypt. An Altar of Ma'at - goddess of justice - helps prevent crime in your city, while an Oracle of  Horus - god of the Pharaoh - makes your employees more willing to attend to their daily labors. In the name of Pharaoh, they'll be inspired to work for the greater good of Egypt.
59-34:  Ptah is the patron god of craftsmen, and helps many of them finish their tasks more quickly. An Altar of Amon - god of the Sun - improves your city's ability to build monuments, while an Oracle of Thoth - god of wisdom and learning - can facilitate the education of your people.
59-35:  When Seth is appeased, your enemies are his enemies. He can help your greenest soldiers fight like seasoned veterans, and even strike down your enemies by his own hand. So powerful is he that his influence even extends to battles fought far afield. Of course, if Seth is not appeased, your city may experience the full might of his destructive powers first hand.
59-36:  As goddess of the home, Bast can improve the quality of life in your city, and can allow your citizens to enjoy a much higher standard of living than might otherwise be the case. So great is her power that she can even help keep the other gods happy. Of course, if she is unappeased, then your city will know true misery and suffering. An Altar of Isis - goddess of healing - can help ensure that your citizens remain in good health, and even assist them if they do get sick, while an Oracle of Hathor - goddess of joy, love and festivity - can help keep your people a little happier in spite of whatever problems they might have.

61-199:  Seers foretell a poor flood this year. They fear that very little rich, fertile mud of the Nile will renew your fields.

Increased worship of Osiris, the god of the Nile flood, will help ensure that this doesn't happen again next year.
61-201:  If seers read the Nilometers right, the good flood expected this year will deposit the rich and fertile mud of the Nile onto your city's fields. Make sure that Osiris, the god of the Nile flood, is kept appeased, or he may decide to withhold this blessing next year.
61-202:  If your city depends on farming the flood plain for its food, the amount of rich and fertile mud that omens indicate could be deposited on your fields by an excellent flood is a bounty not to be taken for granted.  Make sure that Osiris, the god of the Nile flood, is kept happy, so that he will bestow this blessing again.
61-203:  If your city depends on farming the flood plain for its food, the abundant rich and fertile mud that priests hope will be deposited on your fields this year by the perfect flood is an immeasurable bounty not to be taken for granted.

70-37:  Trees are impassable, but may be cleared.  Wood Cutters should be reasonably close to trees.  Woodland regrows over time.  (To select a building, right-click on its foundation).
70-38:  Rocks are impassable and may not be cleared. Perhaps you are lucky enough to have limestone, sandstone or granite for quarrying, although it could be ordinary rock of no value. Check your resources to find out.
70-39:  Only ships and boats travel on water, but ferries and bridges can allow people to cross at certain points. Docks can permit vital trade with the rest of the Kingdom. Clay Pits must be adjacent to water.
70-40:  Impassable terrain that may be cleared to allow city expansion. Wood Cutters need to be near trees in order to harvest timber.  (To select a building, right-click on its foundation).
70-41:  These chasms were caused by earthquakes. They may not be passed or filled in, and people prefer not to live next to them.

70-52:  This is ore-bearing rock. You can mine either gold or copper here, depending on which metal is present.

70-54:  This is Special rock. (this text should not appear anywhere)

70-56:  This area will offer highly fertile land once the river subsides.
70-57:  Marshy areas are too soggy to support structures, but can be traversed by careful citizens. Reeds grow here, but beware of crocodiles!  (To select a building, right-click on its foundation).
70-58:  The shifting sands here can't support structures, but migrants, soldiers and others can walk upon it.  (To select a building, right-click on its foundation). 
70-59:  This is a brick wall. It slows invaders longer than a mud wall would do, but is no substitute for a company of trained soldiers!
70-60:  This is a simple mud wall. It will slow invaders for a short while, but you should not consider it a strong defense.
70-61:  This land will allow all types of crops to grow. The lusher the flowers that grow here, the more fertile it is.
70-62:  These massive cliffs are ideal places to build certain monuments. People cannot walk over this steep terrain, nor can anything be mined from them.

77-7:  This school is deserted. Without mentors in its employ, no new jugglers will be produced.

78-5:  We are badly in need of employees, and will struggle to turn out one new senet master over the next two months.
78-6:  I have no staff other than myself. I cannot be expected to work under these conditions!  At best, I can hone one senet master in three months.
78-7:  With no teachers, no new senet masters will be trained. Senet Houses throughout the city could suffer as a result.

81-3:  This Apothecary is operational and provides potions and unguents to the local community.
82-0:  Mortuary

82-4:  Without linen, we cannot prepare the dead for their journey through eternity.

84-0:  Dentist

85-0:  Scribal School
85-1:  Children of the wealthy must attend neighborhood schools to learn reading and writing if they are to attain their parents' status.

88-11:   gold stolen this year.
89-0:  Fort
89-1:  This Fort is accursed by Seth, and it will be some time yet before any soldiers dare to venture back here.
89-2:  Forts draw soldiers from the city's Recruiter. A Military Academy would provide better-trained troops.

90-1:  Walls need a Gatehouse so that migrants and traders can come and go freely.
91-0:  Tower
91-1:  Build Towers into Walls at regular intervals, or at least in vulnerable areas. When connected to roads, Towers receive guards from the city's Recruiter. Tower guards rain javelins on nearby invaders, and patrol thick enough walls.

91-3:  Our men are at full strength, alert and ready to repel any threats.
91-4:  We have maintenance staff, but we need guards from a Recruiter to defend the city.

94-0:  Temple to Ptah (Craftsman)
94-1:  Laborers and craftsmen worship Ptah to ease their toil. When Ptah is angered, no industry is safe from catastrophe.
95-0:  Temple to Seth (Destruction)
95-1:  Seth watches over soldiers and encourages valor in combat. No man dares fight without the blessing of Seth.
96-0:  Temple to Bast (Home)
96-1:  When Bast is displeased, nobody's home is safe. Some blame Bast for disease, too.
97-0:  Bazaar
97-1:  Our Bazaars make the Kingdom's bounty available to every nearby citizen. Every home needs Bazaar access, although no one wants to live next door to one.
97-2:  This Bazaar is not operational, and supplies nothing to the local community.
97-3:  This Bazaar is operational and supplies the needs of local homes.

100-0:  Shipwright
100-1:  With enough workers, the Shipwright builds military vessels and fishing boats for the city's Wharves. Wood is required to build warships and transport ships; no raw materials are needed to build fishing boats.

101-3:  We are servicing the docked ship. With so few dock workers, though, this could take a long time.
101-4:  We are servicing the docked ship, although this will take a little longer than it would if we were fully staffed.
101-5:  With full employment, we can service the docked ship quickly and efficiently.
101-6:  Any ship that moors here will find no workers to load or unload its cargo.
101-7:  The few dockers employed here would take a long time to load and unload any ships that arrive in port.
101-8:  We are understaffed, so it will take a little longer than normal to load and unload any ships that arrive in port.
101-9:  With full employment, our dockers are just waiting for their ship to come in.
102-0:  Fishing Wharf
102-1:  Boats sail here from the Shipwright to take on crews and begin fishing local waters. Each Wharf can service one fishing boat.

102-7:  Our fishing boat is sailing back from the fishing grounds with its catch.

102-10:  Our fishing boat is not going out into that polluted water!

104-2:  Our architect is hard at work.
104-3:  Our architect is preparing to depart.
104-4:  Currently we have no down time. Our architects are constantly out inspecting and repairing the city's larger buildings.

104-6:  We are understaffed, so we have a week's wait before our returning architects go back on duty.
104-7:  We are badly understaffed and have a two-week gap between each architect's rounds.
104-8:  We are operating on a skeleton staff. We can barely field one architect each month.
104-9:  With no architects on staff, the neighborhood is at the mercy of shifting sands.
105-0:  Palace
105-1:  The Palace is among your city's most desirable buildings and the cornerstone of the city economy. It turns gold nuggets to debens and stores some of the city's funds.
105-2:  Vaults hold
105-3:  Visit your Ratings Overseer?
106-0:  Tax Collector's office

106-8:  We are badly understaffed and go two weeks between collection patrols.
106-9:  With so few people in this office, local citizens can evade much of their tax bills.
106-10:  With no collection staff, this office contributes nothing to the city treasury.
106-11:  Your city needs a Palace before you can collect taxes.
106-12:  Your city needs a working Palace in order to collect taxes.
107-0:  Water Lift
107-1:  This Water Lift can pump large volumes of water when Irrigation Ditches are connected to its front or back sluices.

108-7:  With no delivery staff, this facility could just as well be a dry hole in the ground.
109-0:  Well
109-1:  Citizens without clean water deliveries can draw water from Wells, but Well-water neighborhoods are not the healthiest or most desirable places to live.
109-2:  This well is unneeded. All the houses it serves get deliveries from a Water Supply.
109-3:  This well's water is going to waste, as there are no houses within its service range.
110-0:  Oracle? Does Shrine go here?
110-1:  This Shrine makes nearby homes more desirable and pleases all of the gods. It does not employ priests, though, or provide houses with access to any particular god.
111-0:  Burning ruin

112-8:  This farm is understaffed. Its workers don't grow as much food as they could.
112-9:  There are very few farmers working here. Grain production is scanty as a result.
112-10:  With hardly any workers at this farm, it will produce very little grain this season.
112-11:  This farm's land was blighted by the recent swarm of locusts, and will take some time to recover.

112-13:  fertile.

113-4:  The Overseer of Commerce decreed that lettuce farming should cease.
113-5:  This farm has no workers. Nothing has been planted.

113-7:  This farm is working below maximum capacity, so its crop is smaller than it could be.
113-8:  This farm is understaffed. Its lettuce heads are smaller and fewer than they could be.
113-9:  There are very few farmers working here. The lettuce harvest will suffer greatly for it.
113-10:  With almost no farmers to tend the crop, this will not be a banner year for lettuce.
113-11:  This farm's land was blighted by the recent swarm of locusts, and will take some time to recover.

113-13:  fertile.

114-3:  complete.
114-4:  Pomegranate farming has ceased, by order of the Overseer of Commerce.
114-5:  This orchard has no workers, and the trees are fruitless and gnarled.
114-6:  This orchard has all the workers it needs. The trees bear as much fruit as the land's fertility allows.
114-7:  This orchard is working below maximum capacity, so the crop this year is a bit lighter than it should be.
114-8:  This orchard is understaffed. It produces fewer pomegranates than it could.
114-9:  Very few people work at this orchard. The pomegranate harvest will be small.

117-8:  This farm is understaffed. It cannot reach its potential output.
117-9:  Very few people work at this ranch. Its potential meat production is low.

120-9:  Very few people work at this yard. Wood production is very slow as a result.
120-10:  With hardly any tree-cutters, wood output is at a virtual standstill here.

121-5:  This pit has no workers to dig clay.

144-72:  Hetepsenusret (Kahun): The grand pyramid
145-0:  This mission has no winning or losing conditions.  It is about city building, pure and simple.
146-0:  Please confirm that your new resolution has been set correctly (if you can see this, it has!) This message will time out in 10 seconds.
146-1:  Kingdom location not chosen.
146-2:  I am using the default location.
146-3:  Take me to the Kingdom screen!
147-0:  Well done! By filling your people's bellies with nourishing food and protecting their homes from fire and collapse, you have helped this fledgling civilization take its first step on the long road of history.
147-1:  Excellent. You have built the first true city in this unforgiving land, providing for your citizens' corporal and spiritual needs, and have helped the Thinite confederacy unify the divided land.  
147-2:  Superb!  Your own citizens are beginning to look to you as their caretaker, and neighboring cities also hail you as a provider in times of need.
147-3:  Well done!  Thanks to your capable leadership, Egyptian civilization has advanced considerably, and will continue to do so in the coming decades.
147-4:  Congratulations.  You have built a capital worthy both of the living and the dead.  And, by developing trade relations with other cities, you have introduced your city to the world's stage.
147-5:  Pharaoh applauds you.  Through your skilled management, you have successfully defended your city from Bedouin attack and provided Egypt with the means of defending itself.
147-6:  Pharaoh is pleased.  You have mastered the seas and river and made good use of the resources they offer.  The mighty navy you built patrols the waterways, securing our borders.
147-7:  Pharaoh smiles at your accomplishments.  You have made the most of what the river and sea have to offer, defending our borders with a small but capable fleet of ships.  You have also honored the nobility by providing them with tombs to house their bodies.
147-8:  Well done!  You have met the twin challenges of securing an important trade route and building a prosperous city that provides for even the most discriminating citizens.  Your achievement is truly noteworthy.
147-9:  Well done!  You have established a thriving city that other Egyptian cities look to as an example and that Nubia looks to with envy. 
147-10:  The feat you have accomplished is unmatched.  With your wisdom, a massive pyramid, unlike anything that has been seen before, stretches toward the sky and guarantees immortality to our beloved Pharaoh.
147-11:  You have managed to overcome the dangers of Sinai and supplied Egypt with copious amounts of precious copper and turquoise.  Your deeds will be remembered for generations.
147-12:  Excellent.  The royal necropolis you have endeavored to build is truly splendid. You and your family's years of dedicated service have been richly rewarded with a sacred tomb of your own.
147-13:  Thanks to your skill, Egypt now claims part of Nubia as its own.  Through the city you have established, you have demonstrated Egypt's strength, wealth and grandeur to the conquered Nubians.
147-14:  Pharaoh commends you.  The bent pyramid you constructed in his honor is magnificent and outshines any monument built in the past.
147-15:  Outstanding.  You have played an integral role in a landmark moment: the construction of the first true pyramid.  With the completion of Snofru's pyramid, you have set the standard of pyramid building that all others will follow.
147-16:  Extraordinary.  In spite of poor conditions and continuous attack from fierce Kushites, you have built a fine city and shored up Egypt's southern border.
147-17:  Splendid.  The mines you established at Tura have furnished all the limestone that Khufu has required . . . so far.  With the strong economy based on the productive Tura mines, your city has reached new cultural and social heights.
147-18:  All in Egypt bow to your accomplishments.  You have built Khufu's massive pyramid and supplied it with the richest of burial provisions, and done great honor to Khafra, constructing his final resting place and his formidable sphinx.
147-19:  Well done.  You have made the most of limited resources and brought Ra's power to this isolated spot.
147-20:  Superb.  The glorious Sun Temple you have built honors both Ra and Pharaoh.
147-21:  You have managed to provide for your people while Egypt crumbles around you.  Your family's skill will serve Egypt well in the difficult times to come.
147-22:  While Egypt falls apart around you, you have managed to hold your city together.  These skills will serve Egypt well in the difficult time to come.
147-23:  Even in times of great unrest, your family's considerable leadership skills have returned Thinis to its prior glory.  Your courageous military has helped the Inyotefs defeat their rivals, a feat that will not soon be forgotten.
147-24:  Through your diligence, you have fed a hungry people during a time of war and supplied the necessary reinforcements to defeat this enemy once and for all.  Your accomplishments will not soon be forgotten.
147-25:  Your tireless efforts have given the Kingdom a beautiful and stately new city.  You have also done much for all of Egypt, feeding hungry people in their time of need.  Your considerable efforts shall not go unrewarded.
147-26:  The fine pyramids and obelisks you have built for me stand as testament to my reign, and for that I am deeply grateful.  Your dedication shall be rewarded.
147-27:  Through your unselfish dedication to providing for your people, Egypt now accepts you as the rightful Pharaoh and looks to your dynasty to produce equally benevolent and resourceful heirs. 
147-28:  All bow to your glory, mighty Pharaoh.  You have successfully conquered northern Nubia, while simultaneously providing our Red Sea port with the resources it needed to thrive, assuring that our military forces will have a reliable source of copper.
147-29:  All hail the wise and resourceful Pharaoh.  The new Red Sea trade port is booming, and your support helped establish an equally strong trading post in Nubia.
147-30:  Seth must truly smile upon you, Most Martial Pharaoh.  You have successfully driven out the Nubians, sealing your southern border.
147-31:  The gleaming city of Bubastis does credit to you, Most Capable Pharaoh, and to all Egypt.
147-32:  Egypt rejoices!  The Hyksos have been expelled from our land, and, under your leadership, Egypt is reclaimed. 
147-33:  You successfully inspired your generals to great victories on the field with promises of life everlasting.  The Hyksos and their fearsome chariots have been driven out of Egypt.
147-34:  All-powerful Pharaoh, by turning back the Hittites, Egypt has grown into a mighty empire!  Your sword has given the gift of Egyptian civilization to the world.
147-35:  Most peaceful Pharaoh, your calming influence has brought Egypt to the brink of new greatness!
147-36:  All hail the mighty Pharaoh!  Your dynasty has no peer, and Egyptians from now until the end of time will speak your name with the greatest reverence.
147-37:  All hail the mighty Pharaoh! Your dynasty is without equal, and Egyptians from now until the end of time will speak your name with the greatest reverence.
147-38:  Well done.  The tomb for Thutmose I is complete, an extraordinary accomplishment!  Pharaoh is confident that such a beautifully decorated tomb will please the gods and speed his journey into the afterlife.
147-39:  An impressive feat!  It is rare indeed when workers under such pressure can produce such fine handiwork.  Tutankhamun's tomb is now safely sealed for all eternity.  Let us hope heretic robbers never discover his resting place!
147-40:  An excellent job!  You managed to adequately guard the royal tombs in the Valley and complete the new tomb as ordered.  Pharaoh Seti is most pleased with the exquisite craftsmanship of your workers.
147-41:  A job well done!  Our great pharaoh, Ramses II, did not err when he chose you to oversee the commercial and military development of this land.  But danger rides the wind!  Hittite armies have again arisen to contest our rightful control of this most valuable region. 
147-42:  The hand of Pharaoh has once again beaten the loathsome Hittites.  Great is the rejoicing for our most wise and brave leader, Ramses II!  Your splendid victory in this hard-fought battle will surely be recorded forever in the annals of history.
147-43:  A job well done!  Ramses II is quite pleased with the colossal monument that you created in his honor at Abu Simbel.
147-44:  Well done!  Despite a seemingly unending series of vile plagues and misfortunes, the grand tomb for our aging pharaoh is fully prepared.  Its grandeur speaks well for our appreciation of Ramses II, surely one of Egypt's greatest leaders.
147-45:  The sun has lifted the storm cloud that had been over Egypt.  Great is the joy!  The vile chief of the Libu and his allies from the sea have fled under cover of the night.  Their ill-conceived plan to settle along our shores has been smashed. It is indeed fortunate for us that so many of their women and children are now our shameful captives.
147-46:  Well done!  Your personal courage and steadfastness in battle inspired your troops to perform to their utmost.  The accursed Assyrians have been ingraciously expelled from Egypt's soil.  Word of your deed has reached the Pharaoh and he is indeed pleased.
147-47:  Hail to the hero of Tanis, protector of Egypt!  Your glorious victories on land and on water have secured Egypt's continued independence.  The once-powerful Persians now quake before they speak the name of Pharaoh Achoris.
147-48:  You have done well.  Your wise leadership and careful planning have positioned Alexandria to be the hub of Mediterranean commerce.  It is most unfortunate that Alexander the Great never saw his empire's capital.  At least we have the satisfaction to know that he is now safely entombed within it.
147-49:  The metropolis of Alexandria now shines as a beacon to the world!  Its Great Library is unsurpassed as a center for scholastic learning, and the towering Pharos Lighthouse is already one of the true wonders of the world.
147-50:  Your mighty legions have crushed Ptolemy XIII's rabble.  His drowned body was dredged from the Nile as proof of his death.  The siege has been lifted and Cleopatra is now secure on her throne.  To celebrate the victory and further cement their relationship, Caesar and Cleopatra are now embarked on a journey up the Nile aboard the luxurious royal barge.
147-51:  The splendors of Alexandria and the fate of Egypt are in good hands under your direction.  As expected, when you finally blessed Mark Antony with your presence, he paid you proper homage while seeking your financial aid in furthering his goals.  In fact, he became so enamored of you that he has come to Alexandria to be your companion and lover.
147-52:  With Cleopatra's deep treasury and Antony's genius for tactics, Octavian's fleet and veteran legions have been scattered to the four winds. Romans impatiently await the triumphant return of Antony and Cleopatra. Hand in hand, Rome and Alexandria will rule the Mediterranean for many more generations.
147-53:  Custom Mission Victory
147-54:  You have done well, but many more challenges await you on your quest to become...Pharaoh!

162-9:  Very few people work here. Gold output is rather anemic.

164-6:  We are understaffed. There are delays of up to a week in fire prevention patrols.
164-7:  We have far too few men. Often, no marshals leave the Firehouse for up to two weeks at a time.
164-8:  We are operating with desk staff only. We frequently go a full month without sending a marshal out on the streets.
164-9:  With no staff, this Firehouse is little more than a fire waiting to happen.

170-2:  With no workers, we cannot man our Towers or hire guards to patrol the Walls.
170-3:  Our men are alert and ready to repel any attacks.
170-4:  We have maintenance staff, but we need guards from a Recruiter to defend the city.

171-8:  This guild is understaffed, and supplies fewer carpenters than it could.
171-9:  Very few people work here. There is a considerable wait for a carpenter's services.
171-10:  With hardly any employees at this guild, it seems to take forever for a carpenter to show up.
171-11:  This workshop needs wood delivered to it.
171-12:  Stored wood,

173-12:  Stored stone,
174-0:  Transport Wharf

174-2:  Our transport is in port.
174-3:  Our transport is off transporting.
175-0:  Warship Wharf
175-1:  A warship berths here between battles. Any city on the Nile ought to have at least a couple of defensive ships at the ready.
175-2:  Our warship is in port.
175-3:  Our warship is out defending the city against invasion.
176-0:  Courthouse
176-1:  Courthouses send forth magistrates, who help to reduce crime by ensuring that all grievances get a fair hearing. Courthouse vaults hold part of your city's treasury.
176-2:  This Courthouse has no workers at all, so local citizens solve their own disputes in whatever ways they can.
176-3:  There are so few magistrates available that legal decisions seem almost random to the plaintiffs.
176-4:  With only half the workers it needs, this Courthouse sometimes rushes to judgment.
176-5:  Because it is slightly understaffed, this Courthouse has a small backlog of cases to hear.
176-6:  The Courthouse has all the staff it needs to hear citizens' complaints swiftly and dispatch careful decisions.
176-7:  The magistrate is out resolving disputes.
176-8:  The magistrate is in his chambers.
176-9:  Vault holds
177-0:  This farmland is irrigated.

177-4:  This area will offer highly fertile land once the river subsides.
177-5:  This farm needs laborers, who can be trained at a Work Camp.
177-6:  This farm has a full crew of laborers working the fields.
178-0:  complete. 
178-1:  Workers are now finishing the outside of the pyramid.
178-2:  This task is
178-3:  First, workers need to clear the pyramid site down to bedrock.  More peasants from Work Camps could speed the leveling process.
178-4:  First, workers need to clear the mastaba site down to bedrock.  More peasants from Work Camps could speed the leveling process.
178-5:  Workers are now cutting grooves into the bedrock to hold water.  More peasants from Work Camps would hasten this job.
178-6:  Now we're filling the grooves in the bedrock with water.  More peasants from Work Camps could make this go more quickly.
178-7:  Workers are marking the water level, then draining water from the grooves.    
178-8:  We're very carefully cutting the bedrock down to the water-level marks.  No one will ever see this work, but it ensures that the monument will endure forever.
178-9:  The water-level grooves are being filled with rubble.  It has to be tightly compacted so that the monument won't settle over time.
178-10:  Site preparation is finished!  We've leveled the land, and now we're ready to build the tomb.
178-11:  The base has been leveled and a roof is being placed on the tomb.  Now, there's a resting place fit for eternity.
178-12:  Construction Foreman
178-13:  Do you think gods from the sky are going to build this monument?  Build some Work Camps so that I can get some peasant labor, and quickly!
178-14:  There are no stonemasons available to work on this monument.  If you want progress, build a Stonemasons' Guild at once!
178-15:  I suppose the bricks for this project will magically assemble themselves.  That must be your plan, since you haven't built a Bricklayers' Guild.
178-16:  With no Carpenters' Guild in the city to build ramps or scaffolds, I hope that you're planning on a very short monument!  
178-17:  No peasants have reported for duty.  I'd find out why, if I were you.  Maybe your Work Camps are more like sleep camps.
178-18:  Impressive heap of stone, isn't it?  And that's all it's ever going to be, unless some stonemasons show up.  The Stonemasons' Guild in this city won't win any awards for productivity...
178-19:  Between you and me, the Bricklayers' Guild in this city must be some kind of recreation club.  It's not sending me any bricklayers, that's for certain.
178-20:  I need a carpenter here, and I need him now!  Why don't you apply your leadership skills at that good-for-nothing Carpenters' Guild?
178-21:  An awful lot of people are standing around waiting for a carpenter to show up.  He sure does take his sweet time getting here.  
178-22:  A stonemason without stone is sad to see. Quarry or import more plain stone, or this monument will never take form.
178-23:  You had best quarry or import more limestone, if stonemasons are to build a monument during our lifetimes.
178-24:  Unless the city imports or quarries more sandstone, our stonemason is going to enjoy an early retirement.
178-25:  It won't be much of a monument, with the paltry supply of granite I'm seeing.  Quarry or import more of it.
178-26:  Unless you import more marble, our stonemasons will never be able to finish this monument.
178-27:  Our bricklayers need a lot more bricks than they're getting.  If we can't make them, maybe you can import some.
178-28:  My carpenters lament the shortage of wood.  Cut more trees, or step up the imports.
178-29:  Our masons are ready to add copper to the roof if only it would arrive.  Mine or import more of it.
178-30:  Workers are just clearing and leveling the construction site now.  This would be a fine time to amass some plain stone and limestone.  We are going to need plenty.
178-31:  Everything seems to be going just fine, and the pyramid continues to rise higher and higher.
178-32:  The masons are now doing the fine stone work.  We won't need any more limestone to finish this job.
178-33:  Workers are just clearing and leveling the construction site now.  After that, we'll need plenty of bricks and limestone to complete this monument.
178-34:  Everything seems to be going just fine, and the pyramid continues to rise higher and higher.
178-35:  The masons are now doing the fine stone work.  We won't need any more bricks or limestone to finish this job.
178-36:  Workers are just clearing and leveling the construction site now.  After that, we'll need plenty of plain stone to build this monument.
178-37:  Everything seems to be going just fine, and the pyramid continues to rise step by step.
178-38:  At last, the pyramid is complete!
178-39:  Workers are just clearing the construction site now.  After that, we'll need plenty of bricks for the mastaba.
178-40:  Everything seems to be going just fine.  This mastaba will be done in no time.
178-41:  The mastaba is complete.
178-42:  Finally we have all the granite we need.  Once my carpenters finish building the scaffolding, stonemasons can begin carving the obelisk.
178-43:  My stonemasons are hard at work carving the mighty obelisk.
178-44:  The obelisk is complete!
178-45:  Masons are creating the rough shape of the sphinx.
178-46:  Masons are doing some fine carving on the sphinx.
178-47:  Workers are finishing and painting the sphinx.
178-48:  The sphinx is complete!
178-49:  Carpentry is 
178-50:  Mason work is 
178-51:  All of the city's peasants are needed on the floodplain farms, leaving them only three months out of the year to work on this project.  Build more Work Camps near the monument site to speed things up.
178-52:  Workers can't get to the monument's staging area.  See what's blocking the planks that mark it.
178-53:  Now that we have enough sandstone, we can begin work on the sun temple. My workers are just clearing the site now.
178-54:  Once my carpenters finish building the scaffolding, masons can begin carving the central obelisk for the sun temple.
178-55:  My masons are carving the central obelisk now. When they're done, we'll need more sandstone to finish the rest of the sun temple.
178-56:  As soon as we finish the vestibule, wall and foretemple, this monument will be complete.
178-57:  The sun temple is complete! 
178-58:  Now that we've got enough sandstone, we can start on this monument. My workers are clearing the site now.
178-59:  Masons are working hard to complete this mausoleum.  Everything's on schedule, and I don't expect any problems.
178-60:  The mausoleum is complete.
178-61:  The [monument_name] is [percent_complete] complete.
178-62:  No courses have been completely laid in place yet. 
178-63:  One course has been completely laid in place. 
178-64:  [number_courses_complete] courses have been completely laid in place. 
178-65:  The current course requires [quantity_needed_current_course_main] ([number_loads_current_course_main]) to complete.
178-66:  The current course requires [quantity_needed_current_course_secondary] ([number_loads_current_course_secondary]) to complete.
178-67:  The current course requires [quantity_needed_current_course_main] ([number_loads_current_course_main]) and [quantity_needed_current_course_secondary] ([number_loads_current_course_secondary]) to complete.
178-68:  The remainder of the [monument_name] will require an additional [quantity_needed_remainder_main] ([number_loads_remainder_main]). 
178-69:  The remainder of the [monument_name] will require an additional [quantity_needed_remainder_secondary] ([number_loads_remainder_secondary]).
178-70:  The remainder of the [monument_name] will require an additional [quantity_needed_remainder_main] ([number_loads_remainder_main]) and [quantity_needed_remainder_secondary] ([number_loads_remainder_secondary]).
178-71:  The [monument_name] is now complete, and contains a total of [quantity_total_main].
178-72:  The [monument_name] is now complete, and contains a total of [quantity_total_main] and [quantity_total_secondary].

178-94:  bricks
178-95:  blocks of marble
178-96:  ingots of copper
178-97:  This mausoleum requires a carpenter's services. 
178-98:  The Overseer of Commerce refuses to release plain stone to my workers. He claims you ordered that it be stockpiled. I disbelieve him, but perhaps you should straighten him out.
178-99:  Your Overseer of Commerce says that you commanded him to stockpile limestone. Unless you have a talk with him, my workers will never get any deliveries. 
178-100:  Did you really direct the Overseer of Commerce to stockpile sandstone? He will not authorize shipments from the Storage Yards.
178-101:  Could you ask your Overseer of Commerce to stop stockpiling white marble? We could really use it at the monument.
178-102:  Your Overseer of Commerce says that you commanded him to stockpile granite. Unless you have a talk with him, my workers will never get any deliveries. 
178-103:  Your Overseer of Commerce dares to blame you for the work stoppage! He claims that you ordered bricks to be stockpiled.
178-104:  The Overseer of Commerce told me that you have ordered him to stockpile copper. I'm sure you have a good reason for doing so, but my men can't continue work on the monument without the commodity.
178-105:  The Pharaoh will not be the least bit amused if his life's story is not told in the most elegant fashion.  With no Artisans' Guild, whom do you expect to illustrate the tomb?
178-106:  A rather drab looking tomb, isn't it?  That's how it's going to stay unless some artisans show up soon!  I always thought they were a lazy lot.  You'd better see what the delay is.
178-107:  Without any marble our talented stonemasons have nothing to do.  That is a real shame, as I'd really like to see them much busier.  You had better see to it that some marble gets imported quickly.
178-108:  The roof on this will leak like a sieve if we don't get some copper.  If you can't mine it than you had better import some.  The sooner I get it the sooner this monument will be done!
178-109:  Workers are clearing and leveling the land.  Now would be an excellent time to start amassing a goodly supply of marble.
178-110:  Work is progressing nicely.  The laborers have all the supplies they need.
178-111:  It is hard to believe, but the Overseer of Commerce informs me that marble is being stockpiled in our storage yards.  Without marble, how can you expect work to continue?
178-112:  I've learned from a reliable source that granite is being stockpiled.  Do you expect me to conjure up what I need from the sands of the Nile?  You had better see to it that some granite is made available to my stonemasons immediately.
178-113:  Without a supply of copper how can you expect the roof of this great structure to be completed?  Incredible as it may seem, your Overseer of Commerce has told me that he's stockpiling it.
178-114:  We're waiting for peasants to clear the land.
178-115:  Now that the land is cleared, stonemasons are putting the foundation in place.
178-116:  The foundation is complete, so now we can work on the floor.
178-117:  We're erecting some columns now that the floor is laid.
178-118:  Building a roof is the next step. The columns are complete.
178-119:  Now we need some copper to finish the roof so that it will glisten like the sun.
178-120:  We're just putting the finishing touches on the Library now.
178-121:  Alexandria's Library is finished and is the center of learning in the known world.
178-122:  Peasants are hard at work, clearing the land for the Caesareum.
178-123:  Now that the land is ready, the stonemasons are busy laying a solid foundation.
178-124:  Our tired stonemasons have finished laying the foundation. No rest for the weary, though: construction of the temple is underway.
178-125:  With the central temple complete, work has begun on the patio!
178-126:  >From patios to porticos! Our skillful stonemasons have finished the patio and have begun work on the portico. 
178-127:  The stonemasons have started placing the roof on the portico's pillars.
178-128:  All of the roof sections are in place on the porticos.
178-129:  The Caesareum's majestic entranceway is finished.
178-130:  Stonemasons have finished the Caesareum's interior and have turned their attention to the granite obelisks that adorn the exterior of the building.
178-131:  The Caesareum is complete and celebrates the union between Egypt and Rome.
178-132:  Peasants have begun the arduous task of clearing the land.
178-133:  The stonemasons are busily laying the foundation for the Lighthouse.
178-134:  The foundation is almost complete and the parquet floor is being installed.
178-135:  With the parquet floor complete, the stonemasons have turned their attention to the first tier of the Lighthouse.
178-136:  The stonemasons don't have much time to admire their work on the first tier, for work on the second octagonal tier will begin soon.
178-137:  The Lighthouse is really beginning to take shape. The octagonal tier is done, and the stonemasons will begin the cupola soon.
178-138:  The last piece of the Lighthouse had been laid in place, but the monument won't be complete until the scaffolding is removed. That work is beginning now.
178-139:  Most of the scaffolding has been removed, and the Lighthouse is nearly complete.
178-140:  The Pharos Lighthouse is finished and shines as a beacon over the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
178-141:  Workers are busy working on Abu Simbel. Make sure that the carpenters have plenty of wood so that they can build scaffolding in a timely fashion.
178-142:  The impressive figures of our Ramses II welcome all who approach Egypt from the south.
178-143:  The artisans and masons refuse to step foot in the Royal Burial Tomb without lamps. It is awfully dark in there!
178-144:  The artisans and masons are busy at their crafts, and work on the Royal Burial Tomb is progressing nicely. Remember to keep the Artisans' Guild supplied with clay and paint to help ensure that everything goes smoothly.
178-145:  The Royal Burial Tomb is complete. All that is lacking now are the burial provisions the deceased will need in the Field of Reeds.
178-146:  The hidden Royal Burial Tomb is now ready for the Pharaoh. May Horus guard the tomb and strike down anyone who may dare to violate it!
178-147:  Lamps:
178-148:  Workers can't get to the tomb's entrance.  See what's blocking the way.
178-149:  Workers can't get to the monument's staging area.  See what's blocking their access.
179-0:  Work Camp
179-1:  This Work Camp houses laborers who can work either on floodplain farms or on monuments.
179-2:  This Work Camp needs workers to support the manual laborers based here. 
179-3:  We supply as much unskilled labor as is humanly possible.
179-4:  Our laborers are off looking for work.
179-5:  Our laborers are off working on floodplain farms.
179-6:  Our laborers are off working on monuments.
179-7:  Our laborers are off working on both floodplain farms and monuments.
180-0:  Brickworks
180-1:  Clay and straw are combined here to form sturdy, durable bricks.
180-2:  Production is
180-3:  complete.
180-4:  Your Overseer of Commerce ordered a halt to brick production.
180-5:  This Brickworks has no employees. Not a single brick can be made.
180-6:  This workshop has all the employees it needs. It produces tons of bricks.
180-7:  This Brickworks has some unfilled jobs, which slows down brick production somewhat.
180-8:  This workshop is understaffed, and it takes longer to produce bricks than it should.
180-9:  Very few people work here. Brick production is much slower than it could be.
180-10:  With hardly any workers, this Brickworks will produce very few bricks over the coming year.
180-11:  This workshop needs clay delivered to it, from a Storage Yard or a Clay Pit, to produce bricks.
180-12:  This workshop needs straw delivered to it, from a Storage Yard or a Grain Farm, to produce bricks.

181-1:  Barley is a key ingredient for beer, without which our civilization would surely not exist.
181-2:  Production is
181-3:  complete.
181-4:  Your Overseer of Commerce commanded that barley farming should cease.
181-5:  This farm has no workers. The land lies fallow.
181-6:  This farm has all the workers it needs. It gets maximum yield, given its fertility.
181-7:  This farm has a few job openings. It could grow more barley with more workers.
181-8:  This farm is understaffed. The barley crop could be much better than it is.
181-9:  So few farmers work here that we have barely enough barley for 'lite' beer.
181-10:  With hardly any workers at this farm, Egyptians might soon be reduced to drinking water.
181-11:  This farm's land was blighted by the recent swarm of locusts, and will take some time to recover.
181-12:  Land is
181-13:  fertile.

182-8:  This farm is understaffed. Its workers grow fewer chickpeas than the land could yield.
182-9:  There are very few farmers working here. Chickpea production is far from maximal.
182-10:  With hardly any workers at this farm, the chickpea harvest will be negligible.
182-11:  This farm's land was blighted by the recent swarm of locusts, and will take some time to recover.
182-12:  Land is
182-13:  fertile.

183-6:  This grove has all the workers it needs. It gets maximum yield for its fertility.
183-7:  This grove could use more workers. It would produce more figs.
183-8:  This grove is understaffed. Its workers harvest fewer figs than they otherwise could.
183-9:  There are very few farmers working here. Fig production is far from maximal.
183-10:  With hardly any workers at this farm, it will barely give a fig.
183-11:  This farm's land was blighted by the recent swarm of locusts, and will take some time to recover.
183-12:  Land is
183-13:  fertile.

202-0:  I'm new here.  I wonder what the city will offer to a person like me.
202-1:  I heard there is a job here for anyone who wants one.
202-2:  People say that this city has plenty of food to go around.
203-0:  I can't find a job here. I will look elsewhere.
203-1:  There's not enough food for me to eat. I'm moving out of this desert!
203-2:  Taxes are too high here. I'm surprised I wasn't taxed for leaving.
203-3:  I can't live on what they pay me here.
203-4:  Houses I've seen are overstuffed with people. I can't stay here without a place to live.
204-0:  I've been kicked out of my home, and through no fault of my own.
204-1:  I can't find a place to live!
205-0:  Maybe stealing from his treasury will get that false beard's attention!
205-1:  I take what I want! Don't try to stop me!
205-2:  Thievery is a lot more profitable than other jobs in this city!
205-3:  Take, take, take. That's all I ever do.
206-0:  Ohhh, my stomach! Oh, my head!
207-0:  Plague could break out at any time! I hope it stays in the poor parts of town!
207-1:  That a person of my quality could know hunger is scandalous!
207-2:  I don't think this city could handle an attack, and I have so very much to lose.
207-3:  How can so few workers properly cater to my needs?
207-4:  I'm treated far better than the gods! I hope they don't strike at us.
207-5:  I'm ashamed to live here. I hope our enemies don't take advantage of our reputation!
207-6:  Look at all these idlers! Why don't they get jobs?
207-7:  How can I lead a posh lifestyle if I'm not properly entertained?
207-8:  This city passes muster, I suppose.

212-3:  Job openings are everywhere! Maybe I can get a job as a fire marshal!
212-4:  I hope the gods don't unleash their wrath.  
212-5:  I hear that our city doesn't have a good reputation. We could come under attack!
212-6:  I'll hold on to this job as tightly as I can. I know many people who are out of work.
212-7:  All I ever do is work. There's nothing else to do in this city.
212-8:  I like it here, but there is always room for improvement.
212-9:  I hope I live here forever!
212-10:  (not used)
212-11:  I'm ready to work!
212-12:  With the fields under water, I work now for glory everlasting.
213-0:  I see sick people everywhere. A plague could break out!
213-1:  I'm starving. I'd rather be looking for food than for workers. 
213-2:  City defenses are so weak, I could soon be filling jobs with foreigners instead of Egyptians.
213-3:  Without workers available, my job is impossible.
213-4:  I hope the gods don't unleash their fury. We need to pay more attention to them.
213-5:  Enemies could attack at any time. Our reputation is low, and no one respects us.
213-6:  With so many able people out of work, my job ought to be easy.
213-7:  It's boring here. I wish I could hire more entertainers.
213-8:  I don't mind living here. Things could certainly be worse.
213-9:  This city is the best!
213-10:  I'm the most popular person in the city. A lot of people need jobs.
213-11:  My list of job openings is huge, and I can't find any workers to fill the posts.
214-0:  I am off for a hard day's logging.
214-1:  This timber will be put to good use, I am sure.
215-0:  To the marsh I march for the reeds we need.
215-1:  These reeds will make some fine papyrus.
216-0:  My services are needed at the monument!
216-1:  This monument would be very short without my ramps and scaffolds.
217-0:  It's bricklaying time at the monument!
217-1:  With my bricks, this monument will be strong.
218-0:  I'm going to the monument to shape the stones.
218-1:  My stonework will endure through the ages.
219-0:  So many people have taken ill. I hope they recover soon, or else a plague might break out.
219-1:  I'm starving. Most of my customers demand food, and I can barely feed myself.
219-2:  Our defenses are flimsy. We could easily be invaded.
219-3:  I better be extra nice to my helpers. With this many job openings in the city, I could easily lose them.
219-4:  If we don't soon pay the gods more respect, they are going to dole out a miserable punishment.
219-5:  I wouldn't dream of letting my reputation slip as far as this city's has. We could soon pay the price.
219-6:  I'm lucky to have a job. I know a lot of people who are out of work.
219-7:  Nothing whatsoever happens here. I wish there were more shows to see. 
219-8:  I won't complain about this city... but I could.
219-9:  This city is tops!
219-10:  The bazaar needs some items, and I'm going to get them.
219-11:  These goods will make welcome additions to the bazaar.
220-0:  My supplies sold like hot cakes! I'm going back to the Bazaar for more.
220-1:  I do my best to give the people what they want.
221-0:  These baskets are too heavy for a little kid like me!
221-1:  That bossy lady makes me carry goods all day!
221-2:  Maybe I just carry baskets now, but one day I'll run the Bazaar.
222-0:  I'm not taking these supplies any further until someone's available to unload them.
222-1:  No one can accept these goods! That's okay, I can use the rest.
222-2:  I have to go clear across the city with these goods. It'll take all day!
223-0:  We're doing more than our share of work.  We need more help.
223-1:  I'll wait here until some space for this stuff opens up.
223-2:  Am I there yet?  I can't haul these goods much further.
224-0:  I wonder if this city has any sights I could see while they unload my ship.
224-1:  We're waiting for some cargo to be delivered to our ship.
224-2:  I don't know why we came. This city never trades, and the shore leave is boring.
224-3:  I love the art of the deal! I can't wait to trade my supplies.
224-4:  What a bountiful journey!
225-0:  Our long and dangerous trek here was for nothing! This city won't trade.
225-1:  Buy low, sell high.  That's my motto!
225-2:  It's the trader's life for me!
225-3:  I'll be a hero when I bring these goods back to my home land.
225-4:  You talk a fine bargain, my friend.  I'll barely make back my costs.
226-0:  I've never seen so many sick people. I hope a plague doesn't break out.
226-1:  It's hard to catch these clubs when you're doubled over with hunger pangs.
226-2:  Maybe I can throw these clubs at the enemy should they attack. Little else is defending this city.
226-3:  I see job vacancies everywhere! I wonder if I could juggle more than one job.
226-4:  I'm expecting the worst. The gods must think we've forgotten them.
226-5:  This city has a worse reputation than I do. I hope no one attacks us.
226-6:  I wish there were more jobs in this city. None of the people I entertain can pay me.
226-7:  I can only juggle so much. I wish there were other entertainers in the city.
226-8:  This city isn't too bad.  
226-9:  There's no place I'd rather juggle.
226-10:  I love working these festival crowds. Everyone's so happy!
227-0:  If health doesn't improve in this city, I'll be playing only funeral dirges.
227-1:  I'd sing for my supper, but this city doesn't have enough food.
227-2:  Maybe I could beat invaders over the head with my sistrum.  The city is not defended well.
227-3:  All my performances are solos.  This city doesn't have enough workers.
227-4:  I hope my music soothes the gods. Their anger could soon rain down on us.
227-5:  Our terrible reputation could provoke an attack!
227-6:  For the last time, I am not hiring any more roadies! So many people are looking for work.
227-7:  Even an entertainer likes to be entertained! There's not enough to do here.
227-8:  This city could be a lot worse, I suppose.
227-9:  I hope we continue to make beautiful music in this city for a long time.
227-10:  These festivals are great! Everyone sings along.
228-0:  Many people have taken ill in the city. I hope I don't catch anything!
228-1:  I can't prance and leap very well without enough food!
228-2:  Invaders would have little trouble taking over our city. Nothing defends it.
228-3:  Another dance partner lost to the worker shortage! I hate dancing alone.
228-4:  We should do more to appease the gods - and quickly!
228-5:  This city's reputation is worse than a juggler's! I hope we aren't attacked.
228-6:  If I weren't so light on my feet, I would trip over all these jobless people!
228-7:  (Yawn) I need to be entertained!
228-8:  This city is just about as good as any other city, I guess.
228-9:  This city is fantastic!
228-10:  These festival crowds are so enthusiastic, they make me want to leap higher.
229-0:  People's health is in jeopardy. The risk of plague is great.
229-1:  I'm as hungry as a hippo, but there's little food to be found.
229-2:  I ought to learn the war craft. With our defenses so weak, we're at risk.
229-3:  The worker shortage could cause real trouble in the city.
229-4:  To tell the truth, I would not dare to treat the gods so badly.
229-5:  This city's reputation is checkered at best. We could be attacked.
229-6:  For most, finding work in this city is a trivial pursuit that ends in failure.
229-7:  This city should clue in to the lack of entertainment!
229-8:  I'm not sorry to live here.
229-9:  This city has a monopoly on my heart. I love it here!
229-10:  Get your beer here! Warm, flat, refreshing beer! Low in sediment!
230-0:  The city is flooded with sick people. I hope a plague doesn't break out.
230-1:  No priest of Osiris should have to suffer from hunger!
230-2:  Our city is almost defenseless. I hope no one attacks.
230-3:  Without workers, we may not be able to pay Osiris the respect he deserves.
230-4:  Osiris is not the only god made angry by neglect.
230-5:  Our city is the laughingstock of Egypt. We are ripe for attack.
230-6:  Unemployment is a serious problem in this city. I hope more jobs open up soon.
230-7:  Even a priest needs more than prayers to be entertained.
230-8:  This city is adequate.
230-9:  Osiris is proud to be worshiped in such a fine city.
230-10:  Festivals warm Osiris' heart.
230-11:  Osiris could punish the city for its neglect with a low flood.
231-0:  The people coming to the Temple don't look healthy. I hope the illness doesn't escalate.
231-1:  I don't have enough food to feed Ra or myself!
231-2:  I wish it were up to Ra to defend our city. I don't think this city does a good job of it.
231-3:  I hope this city finds more workers soon. Services could soon suffer.
231-4:  This city would do well to pay more respect to the gods.
231-5:  Reputation is important. Without it, the city is prone to hostile take over.
231-6:  I've never heard more people ask Ra whether they'll finally land a job.
231-7:  I need more entertainment. Pleasing Ra all day isn't easy, and I need to relax.
231-8:  I have no major complaints about this city.
231-9:  The only place better than this city is the Field of Reeds.
231-10:  Ra loves to see his people during the festival.
231-11:  Our city is an embarrassment to the rest of the Kingdom.
232-0:  Poor health could result in plague if nothing is done about conditions in the city.
232-1:  The rumbling of my empty stomach distracts me from my duties to Ptah.
232-2:  Our holey defenses will be useless if anyone chooses to attack us.
232-3:  It saddens Ptah to see industries idle because of the worker shortage.
232-4:  The gods my inflict a just retribution if the city continues to ignore them.
232-5:  Our ill repute could encourage invaders.
232-6:  Ptah wishes that all the unemployed in the city could find productive work.
232-7:  I like to have a good time, just like anyone else. I wish there were more entertainers in this city.
232-8:  This city has its problems, but its a good place to live.
232-9:  This is the best crafted city in all of Egypt!
232-10:  Ptah knows that holidays make workers happier.
232-11:  Ptah's guiding hand can do only so much. The industries in this city need more workers!
233-0:  A plague may wreak havoc on the city if health does not improve.
233-1:  All day, I battle my hunger. I need more food.
233-2:  We'll have to rely on Seth to protect us in battle. The city isn't prepared to defend itself.
233-3:  Services are suffering because no workers can be found!
233-4:  This city should stop provoking the gods' anger with its inaction.
233-5:  We may soon find out how little others think of our city when they sweep in and destroy it.
233-6:  The legions of the unemployed clog the streets.
233-7:  It's hard to believe how dull it is here!
233-8:  This city is suitable enough for me.
233-9:  This city is unrivaled in all Egypt!
233-10:  Even Seth's warriors need the occasional festival.
233-11:  Glory is on the horizon! Enemies are fast approaching the city.
234-0:  Bast cries to see so many sickly people. I hope the plague doesn't strike.
234-1:  It's hard to get enough food in this city. Hunger strikes everyone.
234-2:  Our city's woeful defenses invite our foes to attack us.
234-3:  Our city cannot possible run well with so many job openings.
234-4:  The gods are turning their backs on this city. We should pay them more respect.
234-5:  The city's reputation is terrible. An invasion could come at any time.
234-6:  Not even Bast can lighten the hearts of so many jobless people.
234-7:  Bast is horrified by the lack of entertainment in this city.
234-8:  This city isn't a bad place to live.
234-9:  This city is the greatest!
234-10:  Bast loves a good festival.
234-11:  People in the city are deeply unhappy. They could soon turn to crime.
234-12:  What's a priestess to do? There is so little diversion here.
234-13:  Bast grants me power to heal the sick before they spread their disease.
235-0:  The city may soon learn that bad health can lead to a horrible plague.
235-1:  My mind is fed with learning, but my body hungers for food.
235-2:  Invaders would have no trouble penetrating our scanty defenses!
235-3:  The scarcity of workers reverberates throughout the city, limiting its services.
235-4:  The city's sacreligious ways could cause the gods to smite us!
235-5:  Ah, reputation, reputation. Our scandalous reputation invites attack.
235-6:  Even education won't cure this city's jobless problem.
235-7:  Boring, dull, tedious, monotonous, ho-hum. This city is all five.
235-8:  This city is thoroughly average.
235-9:  This city earns top marks!
235-10:  One can learn much about human nature at a festival.
236-0:  People are sick. My medical papyri tell me that the illness could soon escalate to plague!
236-1:  I'm famished. It's hard to lift my scrolls on an empty stomach.
236-2:  Even the simplest enemy could manage to get through our defenses!
236-3:  Unless more workers arrive soon, the city will surely suffer.
236-4:  The literature is replete with stories of angry gods and their vengeance.
236-5:  History shows that a city like ours will pay serious consequences for its poor reputation.
236-6:  There are a lot of umemployed in the city. At least they have plenty of time to read.
236-7:  Sometimes my eyes like to rest on something other than hieroglyphs. I want to see a show!
236-8:  This city is comparable to others I've read about.
236-9:  This city is the best that history has ever known!
237-0:  I'm afraid to go into some neighborhoods. People are sick, and I don't want to catch anything.
237-1:  I'm weak from hunger. I'm nearly collapsing under the weight of all this water.
237-2:  It seems that it will be up to the citizens to defend this city if it comes under attack.
237-3:  Jobs, jobs everywhere, and not a worker to fill them.
237-4:  If I were a god, I wouldn't be pleased with this city's lack of attention to me.
237-5:  I hear that other cities are laughing at us and are planning to invade.
237-6:  I see plenty of people out of work as I make my deliveries.
237-7:  Carrying water is not entertainment. I wish we had some real diversions here.
237-8:  I like living here, but if I were running the town I'd do some things differently.
237-9:  There is no better place upon this earth.
238-0:  People are so concerned about catching the plague that they're neglecting their teeth.
238-1:  I've had so little to eat lately...what a sad waste of perfect teeth.
238-2:  The city's defenses are full of gaps. Our enemies could have their way with us.
238-3:  This city's workforce is like an old man's mouth. So many holes to be filled!
238-4:  I'm worried about this city's molars - I mean morals! We need to pay the gods more respect.
238-5:  Our reputation is rotten. We could be attacked.
238-6:  I've never seen so many people out of work before!
238-7:  I'm bored! I guess I'll brush my teeth again.
238-8:  This city is okay. Only a few cavities!
238-9:  This city has the brightest smile in all of Egypt.
239-0:  With city health so dismal, I'm a busy man. Still, plague threatens.
239-1:  Being hungry all the time isn't good for me.
239-2:  I'd advise this city to bolster its defenses so our enemies do not do us damage.
239-3:  I've seen many workers pushed to their limits. This city could use more employees.
239-4:  I don't think we're paying the gods enough respect. This is terribly risky behavior.
239-5:  Our base reputation invites others to attack.
239-6:  Sitting idly by waiting for jobs is bad for our people's health!
239-7:  I've had people come in for checkups just because they've got nothing better to do!
239-8:  This city is good enough, I guess.
239-9:  I cannot imagine a healthier place to live.
239-10:  Plague could strike us dead at any moment!
240-0:  Judging by the number of sick people in this city, I could soon have my hands full!
240-1:  I'm famished. Before long, I'll be skinnier than a mummy!
240-2:  The city is not securely wrapped in defenses. An enemy could easily defeat us.
240-3:  If I ever wanted to leave embalming behind, now is my chance. So many job openings!
240-4:  The gods could soon unravel our city if we don't pay them more respect.
240-5:  The city's bad reputation could be the death of us all. We could be attacked at any moment.
240-6:  When I see so many people out of work, it makes me glad that I have a job.
240-7:  This city is as dead as the bodies I work with all day. I wish the city were alive with entertainment.
240-8:  I might as will live here. It's about as good as anywhere else.
240-9:  I feel truly sorry for my clients. They aren't around to enjoy this incredible city!
240-10:  Health seems to be worsening throughout the city.
241-0:  (Not used)
241-1:  Malaria doesn't seem to be a problem here.
241-2:  An outbreak of malaria could strike if something isn't done.
242-0:  I hope a plague doesn't break out. Plagues can spread like wildfire.
242-1:  Even when fires are burning, all I can think about is how hungry I am.
242-2:  If our enemies invade, the whole city could go up in flames.
242-3:  I fear that some of these half-empty buildings could catch fire. I wish there were more workers.
242-4:  The gods' fiery wrath will come down on us if we don't pay more respect.
242-5:  I wouldn't dream of letting my reputation sink so low. Our city's bad reputation is inviting attack.
242-6:  I've had more people volunteer for the fire department. These people need jobs.
242-7:  Firefighting is hard work, and I'd love to cool off with a good show.  There's not enough of that here.
242-8:  I'm satisfied with this city.
242-9:  This city is cool.
242-10:  I can't talk now.  I'm busy dousing this fire.
242-11:  This fire could burn the whole city down if I don't act fast!
242-12:  Ooh, that's hot!
243-0:  A lot of people are in much worse condition than the buildings. I hope things don't get worse.
243-1:  Starvation might not affect the strength of these buildings, but it sure affects mine!
243-2:  How are we to defend ourselves? The city's defenses are laughable.
243-3:  Why does it matter if these buildings collapse? No workers are in them anyway.
243-4:  If the gods are angry, not even the best architect can fix the damage they cause.
243-5:  Our city's reputation is so low, I fear our enemies will attack.
243-6:  By my estimation, a lot of people are out of work.
243-7:  Ho hum. Even architects like a little fun every now and then.
243-8:  Life here could be a lot worse.
243-9:  This city has everything an architect's heart could desire!
243-10:  There are so many places in poor condition, I can barely keep up.
243-11:  I hope I'm credited for the great condition of this city.
244-0:  With so many people so weak and sickly, I fear for the future.
244-1:  I haven't eaten in so long, even I'm considering stealing food!
244-2:  If invaders do come, it looks like it will be up to me to defend the city.
244-3:  If I didn't enjoy the danger of police work, I'd quickly take one of the many available jobs.
244-4:  If I were running things, I'd pay more attention to the gods.
244-5:  I've heard our city is an easy mark for invaders. We have a bad reputation.
244-6:  I don't like to see this many jobless loiterers. I can't walk my beat without tripping over them!
244-7:  This city is dull. I can't find any good shows to see.
244-8:  This city isn't perfect, but then what city is?
244-9:  If only the Bazaar carried donuts, this city would be perfect.
244-10:  Everybody's friendly here. No one is reporting any crimes.
244-11:  A few crimes here, a few crimes there, but nothing out of the ordinary.
244-12:  Even I don't like to walk in this part of town!
244-13:  I'm really too busy to talk right now - ask me again later.
244-14:  I'll do my part to make sure this city is safe!
244-15:  Fighting invaders wasn't in my job description!
244-16:  These rascals aren't taking over the city on my watch!
244-17:  The enemy could soon win if I don't get some help! 
245-0:  It seems an illness is taxing the people's health. I pray a plague doesn't strike.
245-1:  I wish people could pay their taxes in food. I'm so hungry!
245-2:  Our city doesn't seem capable of defending itself!
245-3:  No amount of tax money is going to make this city run smoothly. We need more workers!
245-4:  We owe the gods a great debt, and I don't want to be here when they come to collect!
245-5:  I've heard that invasion is imminent given our standing in Egypt.
245-6:  Many of these houses have unemployed workers! How can they be expected to pay tax?
245-7:  As much as I like collecting taxes, I'd still like to see some professional entertainment.
245-8:  Life isn't too bad here.
245-9:  I'd rather live here than anywhere else!
245-10:  This city could bring in so much more revenue if they'd just hire some more tax collectors.
245-11:  Seems like the nicer their houses, the more people grumble about paying their share.
245-12:  I hate collecting taxes from these run-down houses. It's hardly worth my time.
246-0:  Health conditions in this city are criminal. Plague is the punishment that fits the crime.
246-1:  I'm so hungry, a good meal will buy you any verdict you want.
246-2:  What woeful defenses! Our enemies could walk right into the city and take over.
246-3:  I've never seen so many job openings before!
246-4:  The gods will find us guilty of neglect if we don't start paying more attention to them.
246-5:  Our city is judged among the worst in the Kingdom. I dread the execution of our punishment.
246-6:  Unemployed people have too much time on their hands, and that's dangerous.
246-7:  This city is guilty of poor entertainment options!
246-8:  This city is balanced: nothing too good, but nothing too bad.
246-9:  I judge this city to be the best.
246-10:  (not used)
246-11:  I hope I will earn a funeral procession when the time comes.
246-12:  All is quiet in the court. There is no crime here.
246-13:  I've been trying only petty cases. Nothing too serious!
246-14:  I can barely manage my caseload, yet the streets are still unsafe.
247-0:  My painting and plastering skills are needed at the monument!
247-1:  I capture the stories of Egypt on the walls of the royal tombs.
248-0:  Gold should be for the living, not the dead!
248-1:  Just think of the fortune I'll have when I sell off all those treasures!
249-0:  We'll fight to the death to defend our fair city!
249-1:  The enemy is too much for us! If we escape them, we'll be ready to fight another day.
249-2:  Enemies are coming this way!
249-3:  We're as dangerous as a crocodile, ready to attack our invaders when they arrive.
249-4:  If and when our foes come, we'll be ready for them.
250-0:  Row harder! We must protect our ship at all costs!
250-1:  The enemy is here! All hands prepare for maneuvers.
250-2:  Bring on the attack! We're prepared.
250-3:  We're ready to serve if the need arises.
251-0:  Chariot Exact 1
252-0:  No enemies have been sighted, but we're ready nonetheless.
252-1:  We're coiled like an asp, eager to strike at the approaching enemy.
252-2:  You call that an army?! We'll have no trouble defeating that motley crew.
252-3:  This enemy is a fierce one! I'm doing all that I can to defeat them.

293-7:  Begin Family History
294-0:  Predynastic Period
294-1:  During the Predynastic period, the clans who will eventually rule Egypt take their first faltering steps on the road to civilization. 
294-2:  Your family begins the Predynastic period leading a small band of nomads through their discovery of the arts of civilization. Your leadership helps to set Egypt on its course to eventual greatness, still glimpsed only dimly.  
294-3:  The Predynastic period is the dawn of Egyptian history, and that of your family.  
294-4:  Archaic Period
294-5:  Gradually, the villages established during the Predynastic period coalesce into a unified kingdom, complete with a magnificent capital and its first monumental tombs. 
294-6:  During the Archaic period, the villages that emerged in the Predynastic gradually unite to form the great Kingdom of Egypt. The young civilization founds a capital, secures its borders, masters the waters and builds its first monumental tombs.  
294-7:  Your Family History must be lived in order! Alas, you cannot rule the Archaic period until you first learn the arts discovered in the Predynastic.
294-8:  Old Kingdom
294-9:  Egypt enters a golden age of wealth, might and glory, and erects astonishing new monuments throughout the world. Yet, after attaining these dizzying heights, Egypt fell into war. 
294-10:  Egypt rises to unprecedented might, wealth and glory during the Old Kingdom. Yet, even as incredible new monuments rise throughout the Nile valley, seers make disturbing predictions about the fate of the Two Lands.  
294-11:  You cannot skip ahead while forging your Family History. Before you can enter the Old Kingdom, you must first complete the Archaic period.
294-12:  Middle Kingdom
294-13:  >From its painful genesis, the Middle Kingdom proves to be a time of great opportunity for your family's advancement in the world.
294-14:  The Middle Kingdom, born in strife, proves to be a time of great opportunity for your family. With your leadership, Egypt regains its former splendor...and more.  
294-15:  Family History must unfold in order. The Middle Kingdom cannot begin until the Old Kingdom ends!
294-16:  New Kingdom
294-17:  A fierce new enemy, using an ingenious and unstoppable new weapon, sweeps the Middle Kingdom away. Out of this destruction, Egypt is again reborn.
294-18:  Strange new enemies with a terrifying super weapon bring the Middle Kingdom to its end, and prepare the way for the magnificent New Kingdom to follow. 
294-19:  You cannot diverge from the path of your Family History! Your family cannot experience the New Kingdom until you complete the previous periods.
294-20:  Valley of the Kings
294-21:  The development of a new necropolis in the Valley of the Kings provided a new way to prepare the pharaohs for their journeys to the after life.
294-22:  Grand as they are, the pyramids of your ancestors have eroded over the centuries, the tombs within have been desecrated, and the hidden treasures pilfered by robbers, whom the gods will surely punish throughout eternity!  You will forego pyramids and start a new necropolis in a hard-to-reach wadi across from Thebes, digging tombs into the cliffs to create a Valley of the Kings, safe from robbers.  Or is it?
294-23:  There is a proper time for everything in your Family History. You cannot build the magnificent tombs of the Valley of the Kings until you've completed the splendors of the New Kingdom.
294-24:  Ramses II
294-25:  Ramses II wins Egypt's greatest victory and commemorates his greatness with stunning monuments.
294-26:  Ramses II is third in a dynastic line begun by his grandfather, Ramses I, a vizier of non-royal blood who claimed the throne when Horemheb left no descendent.  You need to achieve military triumphs and construct great monuments that will convince your subjects of your god-like status, fill your enemies with despair, and proclaim Ramses the Great's name and the glory of Egypt for generations to come.
294-27:  Family History must be completed in order. You cannot rule as Ramses II until you have constructed the glorious tombs in the Valley of the Kings.
294-28:  Ancient Conquerors
294-29:  Powerful warriors from distant lands sweep in to try to exert dominance over the riches of Egypt.  After you fend off these threats and welcome the glory of Alexander, you may go to the 'Choose a Mission' area to replay the entire campaign or any of its individual missions.
294-30:  Egypt has many envious neighbors, and they look upon our rich empire the way a hyena pack crowds a lion's kill.  Can you build and command the armies and fleets necessary to defeat these serious threats and defend the Nile Delta against successive invasions by the Sea People, Assyrians and Persians?  Egypt looks to you for protection!
294-31:  Playing this now would create a gap in your Family History. You cannot overcome Ancient Conquerors until you have lived as Ramses II.
294-32:  Cleopatra's Capital
294-33:  The Ptolemy's from Greece restore glory to the land of the pharaohs and stave off the threat from Rome.
294-34:  Alexander the Great himself has paced off the future site of Alexandria-the port city on the Mediterranean Sea that you must now build.  Under the 300-year reign of the Ptolemy's, ending with Cleopatra VII, Alexandria will become the greatest city in the world, exceeding Rome in population and wealth.  Alexander's Mausoleum, the Great Library, the Pharos Lighthouse and the Caesareum are your city's projects.  But what of Rome's mighty legions?  Will they be used for or against Cleopatra's Egypt?
294-35:  Your Family History cannot add the life of Cleopatra to its annals until you have defeated the Ancient Conquerors.

306-0:  Henna Farm
306-1:  The finest henna is grown here and sent to the Paint Maker, who makes the bright paints that decorate tomb walls.
306-2:  Production is
306-3:  complete.
306-4:  Your Overseer of Commerce has decreed that henna production should stop.
306-5:  Without any workers, this farm can't possibly grow any henna.
306-6:  This farm has all the workers it needs. They are in the fields, tending to the plants.
306-7:  This farm could harvest more henna if it had more workers.
306-8:  This farm doesn't have enough workers to tend to an entire field of henna.
306-9:  There are very few people working here. The henna harvest will suffer as a result.
306-10:  Most of this farm is barren. It needs more workers before it can grow more henna.
306-11:  Locusts have devoured all that was growing here, and the land needs some time to recover.
306-12:  Land is
306-13:  fertile.
306-14:  The next henna harvest is in

308-0:  Zoo
308-1:  Exotic animals from near and far delight crowds of citizens at the Zoo.
308-2:  This Zoo has zookeepers, but needs a supply of game meat before any animals can call it home.
308-3:  This Zoo has employees, but with no straw it cannot host any animals.
308-4:  People are afraid to visit a Zoo without zookeepers. Until the Zoo finds some employees, it won't bring the neighborhood any benefit.
308-5:  With no animals, this Zoo is nothing more than empty cages.
308-6:  Game Meat:

309-0:  This danger of disease is so great that even the laughing hyenas are sad.
309-1:  How will we feed the animals when we can't feed ourselves?
309-2:  Our defenses are terribly weak. Perhaps I should train the hippo to fight?
309-3:  Even an elephant cannot recall when the worker shortage has been worse.
309-4:  When a god is angry you don't want your neck sticking out like a giraffe's!
309-5:  Pharaoh is so unhappy. I hope the zoo animals are not needed for exotic gifts!
309-6:  Trying to land a job in this city is more difficult than trapping a wild lion.
309-7:  The entertainment situation in this city stinks worse than the monkey cages.
309-8:  Living here is better than sleeping in the lions' pen.
309-9:  I am happier than a mud-covered hippo to be living in this city.

312-0:  Artisans' Guild
312-1:  Artisans meet here to prepare plaster from clay and mix their paints before heading out to decorate a tomb. 
312-2:  This guild has no employees and cannot send out any artisans.
312-3:  This guild has a full palette of artisans who waste no time decorating the interiors of tombs.
312-4:  This guild lacks an artisan or two. Tomb painting has slowed a little bit.
312-5:  This guild is doing its best to provide artisans to the tomb and provides fewer tomb artisans than it could.
312-6:  This guild needs many more workers. The few lone artisans that work here are doing what they can to decorate the tomb, but they need more help.
312-7:  Paint in the tombs has plenty of time to dry. Unless this guild finds more workers, the tomb may take an eternity to decorate.
312-8:  Artisans are hard-pressed to decorate a tomb without the paint it needs from a Paint Maker or Storage Yard.
312-9:  The guild won't send any artisans to the tomb until it receives a supply of clay.

313-0:  Paint Maker
313-1:  Here, henna is crushed and processed into paint, which artisans use to lavishly decorate the walls of Royal Burial Tombs.
313-2:  Production is
313-3:  complete.
313-4:  Your Overseer of Commerce has stopped paint production.
313-5:  This Paint Maker's staff has completely dried up. With no workers, no paint can be made.
313-6:  With a full staff, this Paint Maker produces paint as quickly and efficiently as it can.
313-7:  This Paint Maker's staffing level is a little thin, so paint production is compromised.
313-8:  This Paint Maker is understaffed, and produces paint more slowly than it should.
313-9:  This Paint Maker needs many more workers. Paint production here has slowed to a crawl.
313-10:  Only a few workers are employed by this Paint Maker. The small staff can hardly turn out any paint at all.
313-11:  This workshop needs henna from a Henna Farm or Storage Yard before it can make any paint. 
313-12:  Henna:
